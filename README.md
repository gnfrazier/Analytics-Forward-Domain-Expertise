### Analytics-Forward-Domain-Expertise
My slides from Analytics Forward March 9th 2019.

Install RISE slide show.

If you have Conda configured:
```
conda install -c conda-forge rise
```

PIP based install:
```
python -m pip install RISE
```

Then activate the installation:
```
jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix
```

If you had a notebook server running during the install you will need to restart it for the RISE extension to show in your notebook.
